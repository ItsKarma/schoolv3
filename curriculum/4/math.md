# Section 1 - Numbers and Operations

1.1: Apply place value concepts to show an understanding of multi-digit whole numbers.

1.2: Use place value understanding and properties of operations to perform multi-digit arithmetic.

1.3: Extend the understanding of fractions to show equivalence and ordering.

1.4: Build fractions from unit fractions by applying and extending previous understandings of operations on whole numbers.

1.5: Connect decimal notation to fractions, and compare decimal fractions (base 10 denominator, e.g, 19/100).
